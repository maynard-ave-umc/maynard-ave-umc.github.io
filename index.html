                <p>There is a joy as old friends reunite and new sisters and brothers are welcomed. Ours is a "blended" worship -- meaning that we incorporate elements of both contemporary and traditional worship, so that the language of every heart gets spoken. The voices and gifts of our children and youth are featured often. The music is homespun and heartfelt, yet excellent in quality. There are choirs for adults and children, as well as hand bells and Praise Team. There is community time, when joys and concerns are lifted together to God. Worship is a primary way to give honor and glory to God. Won't you come and celebrate with us Christ's love and acceptance of all?</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4">Our History:</h2>
                <p>Maynard Avenue United Methodist Church was chartered with forty-one members in 1909 as Grace Methodist Protestant Church. For several months, services were held in a house on Indianola Avenue. When it became too crowded, a tent was erected on part of what is now the church parking lot. The first pastor was Samuel Heininger of Indiana. His work was blessed and the young congregation grew rapidly in influence in the community.</p>

                <p>The first part of the church building was constructed in 1910, and in 1914 it was remodeled and enlarged. Work began in 1926 on the present form of our building. The parsonage across the street was completed in 1922. Maynard Avenue Church was well known for our food booth at the nearby Ohio State Fair, which was in operation each year since 1916, except during WW II when the fair was canceled. What started with soup homemade by Sunday school classes and the Women's Society grew to a full-scale grill and restaurant staffed by dozens of volunteers. Unfortunately the fair booth was disbanded in 2011, serving our community for 97 years.</p>

                <p>The membership of Maynard Avenue Church increased as the neighborhood flourished, once welcoming nearly 700 persons in multiple services on Easter. After about 1960, however, like many other urban congregations, Maynard Avenue Church gradually declined. Members moved farther north and new neighborhood residents did not connect with this church.</p>

                <p>Worship attendance reached as low as 60 persons. But in recent years, the congregation has reconnected with the neighborhood, reached many gay and lesbian Christians, and been revitalized by a sense of God's mission and vision. Average worship attendance is now growing from just over 100.</p>

                <p>We have been blessed by a rich history and feel called to an even greater future of making disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-8">
        <p>The insignia is a cross linked with a dual flame. This symbol relates our church to God by way of the second and third persons of the Trinity; the Christ (cross) and the Holy Spirit (flame).</p>
        <p>Apart from Wesleyan Trinitarian theology and warmth, the flame has two other connotations. The flame suggests Pentecost when witnesses saw “tongues as of fire.” And the duality of the flame was meant to represent the merger in 1968 of two denominations: The Methodist Church and the Evangelical United Brethren Church.</p>
